# EL_LIGARDO_DATA_CORE

→ Central data spine for the EL LIGARDO Phase-2 ecosystem.

This repository houses the authoritative records that define the ongoing YouTube Shorts algorithm campaign, including:

- Phase-2 ingestion logs
- Automation output
- Retention/CTR/loop-signature analytics
- Dataset deltas and comparative frames
- Public research summaries
- Archival metadata for all aliases in the Ligardo network

Every directory inside this structure corresponds to one operational layer of the system.
No marketing. No narrative. Only evidence.

## Directory Structure (Top Level)

\`\`\`
00_MASTER_ARCHIVE/
01_YT_ANALYTICS/
02_SHORTS_MEDIA/
03_SUBSTACK/
04_DOCUMENTS/
05_ARCHIVE_TRANSFER/
\`\`\`

Each folder is contract-bound to a specific subsystem.
Updates propagate only through authenticated pushes from the main operational machine.

## Operational Protocol

- Main branch is authoritative.
- All changes flow through structured commits only.
- No destructive rewrites without explicit instruction.
- Repository serves as long-horizon memory for the Phase-2 engine.

## Purpose

To maintain a permanent, transparent, and auditable spine of the project’s evolution.
This is the debris trail of our warpath: every move, every Short, every metric, preserved.
